#Shittpd
###The Super Hyper Interwebs Text Transfer Protocol Daemon  

Shittpd is a simple, but dysfunctional http server, hence the name shittpd. If you take a quick glance at the code, it is clear that I don't know what I am doing.

It doesn't work right now. It responds to all requests with "The Super Hyper Interwebs Text Transfer Protocol Daemon".

Shittpd is just a project to help me learn more about sockets and threading. Hopefully within the near future it will work properly.
