###The Super Hyper Interwebs Text Transfer Protocol Daemon  
Pronounced shit-tee

Shittpd is a simple, but disfunctional http server, hence the name shittpd.

It doesn't work right now. It responds to all requests with "The Super Hyper Interwebs Text Transfer Protocol Daemon".

Shittpd is just a project to help me learn more about sockets and threading. Hopefully within the near future it will work properly.
